Components of the system
* finite state machine
* flight simulator
* flight controller
* logs
* tests
* ci
* examples located inside the src/bin folder (with wiring image and explanation)


Notes:
* It would be important to make something that works asap
* create basic examples with all the components you need to determine if this project is do-able for me in rust.



expected problems:
* is there a rust interface for working with the motor drivers that im gonna use ? Would probably need to write one
*
